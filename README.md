## The Problem

Recently, X.com updated its UI for Premium subscribers, changing the colorful, distinct icons for features like "SuperGrok", "Analytics", and "Monetization" to a uniform, monochrome grey. This change makes it harder to quickly identify and navigate to the desired feature. The new design applies multiple CSS background gradients on top of each other, which overrides any simple attempts to restore the original background colors.

## The Solution

This extension solves the problem with a targeted and robust approach:

1.  **Activates Only on the Premium Page**: The extension's logic runs exclusively on the `/i/premium` URL, ensuring it doesn't interfere with any other part of X.com.
2.  **Scopes to Main Content**: It specifically targets the main content area (`[role="main"]`) to avoid accidentally modifying elements in the sidebar or other regions.
3.  **Removes Conflicting Styles**: It uses `background-image: none !important;` to strip away all of the conflicting gradient layers that X.com applies, allowing the true background colors to show through.
4.  **Restores Colors**: Using CSS variables for maintainability, the extension applies the original, vibrant color to each specific icon, making the panel scannable and visually distinct again.
